# How to Build a Schema Converter from 12V to 220V with 1000W Power
 
A schema converter is a device that can change the voltage and frequency of an alternating current (AC) power source. It is useful for powering devices that require a different voltage or frequency than the available power source. For example, you may want to use a schema converter to power a 220V device from a 12V battery.

In this article, we will show you how to build a schema converter from 12V to 220V with 1000W power using a simple circuit diagram. You will need the following components:
 
- A 12V battery
- A transformer with a primary winding of 12V and a secondary winding of 220V
- A MOSFET switch
- A resistor
- A capacitor
- A diode
- An oscillator
- A load (such as a light bulb or a fan)

The circuit diagram is shown below:

The working principle of the schema converter is as follows:

1. The oscillator generates a square wave signal with a frequency of 50 Hz (or 60 Hz depending on your country).
2. The square wave signal is fed to the gate of the MOSFET switch, which turns it on and off alternately.
3. When the MOSFET switch is on, it connects the primary winding of the transformer to the 12V battery, creating a magnetic field in the transformer.
4. When the MOSFET switch is off, it disconnects the primary winding from the battery, collapsing the magnetic field in the transformer.
5. The changing magnetic field in the transformer induces an AC voltage in the secondary winding, which is stepped up to 220V.
6. The diode rectifies the AC voltage to DC voltage, which is smoothed by the capacitor.
7. The resistor limits the current to protect the load from overloading.
8. The load receives a DC voltage of about 220V with a power of about 1000W.

That's it! You have successfully built a schema converter from 12V to 220V with 1000W power. You can use it to power any device that requires a DC voltage of about 220V and a power of about 1000W. However, be careful when handling high voltages and currents, as they can be dangerous. Always follow safety precautions and wear protective gear when working with electricity.

If you want to test your schema converter, you can connect a load such as a light bulb or a fan to the output terminals of the circuit. You should see the load turn on and off according to the frequency of the oscillator. You can also measure the voltage and current across the load using a multimeter. You should get a reading of about 220V and about 4.5A, which gives a power of about 1000W.
 
However, keep in mind that this schema converter is not very efficient or reliable. It has several drawbacks, such as:

- It produces a lot of heat and noise, which can damage the components and reduce their lifespan.
- It does not have any protection against short circuits, overloads, or power surges, which can cause fires or explosions.
- It does not have any regulation or stabilization of the output voltage or frequency, which can harm the devices connected to it.
- It does not have any isolation or grounding of the input and output terminals, which can cause electric shocks or electrocution.

Therefore, we do not recommend using this schema converter for any serious or long-term applications. It is only meant for educational or experimental purposes. If you need a more efficient and reliable schema converter, you should buy a commercial one from a reputable manufacturer or supplier.
